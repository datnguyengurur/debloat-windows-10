function Update-IPv4Address {
    <# 
    .SYNOPSIS
    Update-IpAddress changes the IP of a NIC and deletes the old IP Address configured on that NIC. It can also disable DHCP (or not) for that interface and disable (or not) DNS registration.
    .EXAMPLE
    Update-IPv4Address -ComputerName Fs1 -InterfaceAlias Ethernet1 -NewIPv4Address 192.168.1.101 -PrefixLength 24 -DisableDhcp Yes -DisableDnsRegistration No -Verbose
    Sets IP Address 192.168.1.101 on server Fs1, on NIC "Ethernet1." DHCP is disabled for the NIC, and DNS registration is enabled.
    .EXAMPLE
    Update-IPv4Address -ComputerName Node1 -InterfaceAlias "Ethernet #5" -NewIPv4Address 10.0.1.5 -PrefixLength 16
    Sets IP Address 10.0.1.5/16 on server Node1, on NIC "Ethernet #5." DHCP is disabled for the NIC, and registration is enabled.
    .EXAMPLE
    Update-IPv4Address -ComputerName Server3 -InterfaceAlias "LAN2" -NewIPv4Address 192.168.5.5 -PrefixLength 24 -DisableDnsRegistration Yes
    Sets IP Address 192.168.5.5/24 on server Server3, on the NIC "LAN2." DHCP is disabled for the NIC, and DNS registration is disabled.
